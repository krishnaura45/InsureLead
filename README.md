Predicting Customer Responses to Insurance Offers Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project tackles the Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling using machine learning. The objective is to identify which customers are most likely to respond positively to an automobile insurance offer. Leveraging customer demographic and vehicle information, we build and evaluate predictive models to optimize marketing strategies in the insurance domain.

### Key components:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Model development (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- Performance evaluation (ROC-AUC)
- Hyperparameter tuning & ensembling
